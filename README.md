Sudoku Solver
=============

This is a <b>Java program that solves sudokus in a logical way</b>, like a human would - try to find a cell to fill or tackle out candidates for a cell. Not all sudoku solving methods are implemented though.

## Light version
This branch is a light version of the program. It only contains the class <b>Main2</b> which brute-forces the sudoku and simply shows the final solution. This class works alone, but you need to modify the code to enter the starting numbers of the sudoku, also it prints the solution in console (Eclipse console for example).

## Full program
For the full program (with the logical way), go on the branch master.
